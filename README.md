# Dremio Load Tester
Dremio Load Tester enables organizations to understand and predict the performance of their cluster under current and future production workloads. Solution architects can easily understand when user demand will require system configuration changes or additional resources, and how to apply reflections to optimize their users’ experience. 

Using Dremio Load Tester, both the cache of input queries and the user concurrency are completely adjustable, giving system engineers the opportunity to model the results of what-if scenarios and new use cases with a high level of accuracy. Dremio Load Tester leverages Apache JMeter to measure individual query performance and then uses Dremio itself to drill down into the execution time of each query. 

## Usage
